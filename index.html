            Hi! Coding from Scratch,
            I'll try to cover everything you need to know to become a homemade coder. Throughout this course, we 
            will cover the most basic concepts and move on to the first real programming
            languages.
            <h1 class="chapter-title">
                What you will find here
            </h1>
            The programming courses I have taken generally focus mainly on
            superficially explaining how a single programming language works so that
            you can write working code immediately. If, however, you would like to
            deepen your studies to fully understand how the famous Print("Hello word")
            realy works this is the place for you.
            <br>
            This will lead to an incredible
            number of advantages in the long run since (a little-known secret) 
            most programming languages are based on the same simple mechanisms 
            and the only thing that changes is the syntax (the so-called sugar syntax).
            <br>

            Therefore, once you have mastered these small mechanisms, and once you have
            imprinted in your mind the big picture of programming, you will be able to
            choose for yourself which programming language to begin with and in which
            area you want to specialize. But this doesn't mean we will completely
            avoid the practical aspects (I don't want this to be one of those textbook
            walls that is impossible to crack), we will begin to discuss how the concepts
            explain translate into modern languages as soon as possible.
            <br>
            I would like to
            make it clear that the purpose of this project is precisely to explain
            the big picture behind programming and thus not to go into the technical
            details of everything (which I will explain briefly or not at all)
            but to explain clearly and simply the various concepts one by one
            and then connect them. 
            <br>
            Moreover, I am not a professional, but an enthusiast 
            with a few years of study who wants to save you from the trouble of collecting 
            information and linking it independently. So if you find any parts that are unclear or have any errors, 
            I invite you to report them on them socials I am on or through my email : <br>
