            The purpose of this chapter is to quickly explain how we will proceed along this path.
            If the number 0 sounds strange, be aware that computer science always starts with 0 
            and not 1. I don't know if this is a method that someone has already invented, but personally
            I have not seen it explained by anyone before.

                Big picture
            </h1>
            Contrary to most of my homies i have always loved to study.
            And after some debate I came to the conclusion that it is probably 
            because I see studying differently from my friends. So try to think 
            about something you take for granted such as speaking. How did you learn to speak? 
            Well usually in school they taught you the alphabet and the sounds of each letter, 
            then they taught you that by putting the letters together you could form many words 
            each with a different meaning. Afterwards you put the words together into sentences 
            according to precise rules. Et voila the magic is done now you know how to speak.
            I call it the big picture method because in my head these steps are like a very complex 
            big picture that is made up of the various parts where each one is the logical consequence 
            of the previous. Isn't this a more fascinating approach to studying than memorizing information 
            and taking it for granted? That method can be applied to more complex things. For example, 
            mathematics is constructed entirely in this way starting with axioms and expanding the picture 
            through theorems and demonstrations. Regarding computer science, I have never found anyone using 
            this method with balance. If you study independently at home, you will only find superficial 
            lessons on specific languages. On the other hand studying at school the picture is often 
            overwhelmed by a mountain of boring and often useless technical details. Here in this path 
            I will do my best to make the picture obvious so that when we get to see the first line of 
            code it is obvious why and how it works.

            I managed to get in touch with a real expert who will help us on our path. Unfortunately, 
            he's a bit shy, so he won't introduce himself today, but you'll see him in the next chapter. 
            He kindly invited us to sleep at his house. Look at this breathtaking view
